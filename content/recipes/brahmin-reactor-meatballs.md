## Brahmin Reactor Meatballs  
**Core Ration • High-output • Cafeteria-grade comfort**

### Vault-Tec Lore

Before the war, Brahmin meat was marketed as the ultimate protein source—resilient, filling, and adaptable to nearly any recipe. After the bombs fell, Vault-Tec reformulated this cafeteria classic into what became known as **Brahmin Reactor Meatballs**: dense, savory protein spheres designed to keep dwellers full, focused, and docile.

Served weekly in most Vault cafeterias, these meatballs were engineered to be comforting enough for children, satisfying enough for adults, and sturdy enough for leftovers.
