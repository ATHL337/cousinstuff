## Sugar Bombs Protein Crunch Parfait  
**Dessert Ration • Sweet, crunchy, creamy, morale-boosting**

---

### Vault-Tec Lore

Before the war, Sugar Bombs™ were aggressively marketed as the “breakfast of tomorrow.”  
After the war, survivors realized that dumping them into anything remotely edible made life feel slightly less terrible.

Vault-Tec’s **Sugar Bombs Protein Crunch Parfait** preserves that joyful chaos—layering crunchy cereal, smooth vanilla cream, and fresh fruit into a dessert that feels indulgent but secretly delivers real nutrition.

*"If it crunches, it counts."* — Vault-Tec Culinary Division
