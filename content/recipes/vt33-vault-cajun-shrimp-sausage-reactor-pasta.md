## Instructions

### Hydrograin Deployment
- Boil salted water; cook **penne** to al dente.  
- Reserve **½ cup pasta water**, then drain and set aside.

### Protein Activation
- Heat **1 tbsp oil** in large skillet (MED-HIGH).  
- Add **kielbasa** → sauté 4–5 min until browned; remove and set aside.  
- Add **remaining oil**, then **shrimp**.  
- Season shrimp lightly with Cajun seasoning; cook 1–2 min per side until pink.  
- Remove shrimp; hold warm.

### Reactor Sauce Formation
- In same skillet, reduce heat to MED.  
- Add garlic (and onion if using fresh) → sauté 1–2 min until fragrant.  
- Add tomato sauce → stir to deglaze, scraping fond from pan.  
- Add heavy cream, chicken bouillon, and all spices (Cajun, paprika, oregano, basil, etc.).  
- Simmer 5–7 min, stirring, until sauce thickens slightly and turns a rich orange-red.  
- Taste and adjust salt or chili sauce to desired heat.

### Integration Phase
- Return **kielbasa and shrimp** to sauce.  
- Add **cooked penne** and splash of **reserved pasta water** (as needed for coating).  
- Toss over MED heat 2–3 min until sauce clings evenly.

### Plating Directive
- Serve immediately, garnished with parsley and Parmesan.  
- Optional: sprinkle with extra Cajun seasoning for Vault heat calibration.

## Overseer’s Notes

- **Spice Control:** For kids or low-heat ration, halve chili sauce and Cajun seasoning.  
- **Flavor Depth:** Add ¼ cup white wine or broth before the cream to lift acidity.  
- **Texture:** Use ⅓ cup of the pasta water at finish for a glossy, silky sauce.  
- **Next-Day Utility:** Reheat with splash of cream or milk to restore sauce consistency.

## Pairings

- **Side:** Simple green salad or roasted veggies  
- **Bread:** Toasted Vault garlic flatbread
