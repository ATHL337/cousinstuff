## Instructions

### Hydrograin Deployment

- Reserve **1/2 cup pasta water**, then drain and set aside.

### Protein Activation
- Heat **1 tbsp oil** in a large skillet (MED-HIGH).

### Reactor Sauce Formation

- Add tomato sauce → stir to deglaze, scraping fond from the pan.  
- Add heavy cream, chicken bouillon, and all spices.  
- Simmer 5–7 min, stirring, until the sauce thickens slightly and turns a rich orange-red.  
- Taste and adjust salt or chili sauce to desired heat.

### Integration Phase

## Overseer’s Notes

- **Spice Control:** For kids or low-heat rations, halve chili sauce and Cajun seasoning.  
- **Flavor Depth:** Add 1/4 cup white wine or broth before the cream to lift acidity.  
- **Texture:** Use 1/3 cup of the pasta water at finish for a glossy, silky sauce.  
- **Next-Day Utility:** Reheat with a splash of cream or milk to restore sauce consistency.
