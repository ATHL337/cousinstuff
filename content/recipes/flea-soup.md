## Flea Soup
**Dark broth • Gentle warmth • Signature specks**

### Vault-Tec Lore
Vault-Tec’s sanitized version preserves the appearance of the original without any actual fleas involved.

## Overseer’s Notes
- This soup is about appearance as much as flavor.
- Specks should be visible but not overpowering.

## Pairings
- Vault bread or dinner rolls
