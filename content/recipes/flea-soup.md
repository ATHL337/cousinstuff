## Flea Soup  
**Dark broth • Gentle warmth • Signature specks**

---

### Vault-Tec Lore

Flea Soup is a wasteland classic, first popularized by traveling merchants who believed any meal could be made palatable with enough seasoning, warmth, and confidence.

Vault-Tec’s sanitized version preserves the *appearance* of the original—complete with its iconic floating specks—without any actual fleas involved. The result is a deeply savory broth, comforting protein, and a visual texture that makes Overseers nervous but children curious.

*"If it looks questionable but tastes amazing, it's probably Flea Soup."*

## Ingredients

### Core
- 1.5 lb beef stew meat (or chuck, cubed)
- 9 cups beef broth (dark, rich)
- 1½ tablespoons soy sauce or tamari
- 1½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

### Aromatics
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1½ teaspoons grated ginger (optional)

### Flea Specks (Visual Effect)
- 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds
- 1½ teaspoons black sesame seeds

### Warmth & Balance
- ¾ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 pinches sugar (optional)
- Salt to taste

---

## Instructions

### Simmer
- Add beef, broth, soy sauce, Worcestershire, onion, garlic, and ginger to a large pot.
- Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for about 20 minutes, until beef is tender.

### Season
- Add smoked paprika, black pepper, and salt.
- Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

### Speck Deployment
- Stir in the sesame seeds just before serving.
- They should float and drift naturally, creating the signature “flea speck” effect.

### Serve
- Ladle into bowls.
- Do not over-stir—specks should remain visible.

## Overseer’s Notes

- This soup is about *appearance* as much as flavor.
- Specks should be visible but not overpowering.
- Kids love the look. Adults pretend they don’t.
