## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter  
- 1 tsp olive oil  
- 2 tsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped (or 3/4 tsp dried)  
- 1.5 tsp fresh thyme, finely chopped (or 3/4 tsp dried)  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 bay leaf  
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped  
- 3 medium carrots, sliced  
- 1 red bell pepper, diced  
- 1 small leek, thinly sliced and rinsed (white + light green parts)  
- 4 oz green beans, trimmed and chopped  
- 1/2 cup frozen corn kernels (about 75 g)  
- 1 1/2 cups cauliflower, diced  
- 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth  
- 28 oz cooked chicken breast, shredded  
- 1 tsp kosher salt (divided), adjust to taste  
- 1/2 tsp black pepper, adjust to taste  
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika  
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce (or 1 tsp low-sodium soy sauce)

## Instructions

### 1) Infusion Protocol
In a small pan over medium heat, melt the butter with olive oil. Add rosemary, thyme, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Cook 45–60 seconds until fragrant. Remove from heat and set aside.

### 2) Vault Base Activation
In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the infused butter mixture over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, bell pepper, bay leaf, and about 1/2 tsp salt. Cook 5–6 minutes until softened.  
Lower heat, cover, and let vegetables release moisture for another 6–8 minutes.

### 3) Broth Deployment
Add broth and diced cauliflower. Bring to a gentle simmer. Cook 6–8 minutes until tender.  
Add green beans and leek. Simmer 3 minutes.

### 4) Protein Reintegration
Add shredded chicken, corn, Worcestershire, black pepper, smoked paprika, and remaining salt to taste. Simmer 3–4 minutes until heated through.  
Remove bay leaf. Adjust seasoning.
