Approximate values (varies by tortilla brand and shrimp size):
- **Calories:** ~400–480  
- **Protein:** ~35–45 g  
- **Carbs:** ~20–30 g  
- **Fat:** ~15–20 g *(use the “Cut-Fit Switches” below to lock this in)*

## Vault Notes

### Kid / Adult Spice Split (Clean)
- **Kid-safe base:** omit chili powder from the marinade.
- **Adult add-on (after plating):** add hot sauce, pickled jalapeños, chili flakes, or a spicy salsa to **your** tacos only.

### Cut-Fit Switches (Use These to Hit Your Macro Day)
Pick 1–2 depending on how your day is tracking:
- **Need more fat (common with shrimp):** keep the **2 tbsp olive oil** in the marinade (best flavor + macro support).
- **Need lower carbs:** run **1 tortilla + 1 “taco bowl”** (shrimp over cabbage with salsa + yogurt).
- **Need more protein:** add **extra 60–90 g cooked shrimp** to your serving (keep tortillas the same).
- **Need higher volume without calories:** double the cabbage.

### Air Fryer Option (Shrimp)
- Preheat air fryer to **400°F (204°C)**.
- Arrange shrimp in a single layer (work in batches).
- Air fry **5–7 minutes**, shaking once, until opaque and lightly browned.

## Storage + Reheating
- **Fridge:** store cooked shrimp in a sealed container **up to 3 days**.
- **Best leftover format:** lunch bowls (shrimp + cabbage + salsa + yogurt).
- **Reheat shrimp:** quick skillet 60–90 seconds or microwave in short bursts (avoid overcooking).
- **Tortillas:** store sealed; warm fresh each time for best texture.

## Serve With
- Extra cabbage slaw
- Lime wedges
- A simple side salad (greens + vinegar)
- “Afterburn” hot sauce for adults only
