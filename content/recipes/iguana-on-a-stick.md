## Lore

Pre-war roadside vendors once claimed these were real iguana.  
Post-war survivors stopped asking.

Vault-Tec™ now certifies these skewers as **100% non-mutated**, charred to perfection, and suitable for surface expeditions, morale nights, and family rations.

No scales. No tails. Just pork.
