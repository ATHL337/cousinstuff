### Vault-Tec Lore

In the wasteland, “iguana” is… a flexible term. Vault-Tec recommends you don’t ask follow-up questions.  
This approved version uses clean pork chunks, a tangy-sweet marinade, and a high-heat cook that gives you crisp edges and tender centers.

*"If it comes on a stick, it’s probably safe. Probably."*
