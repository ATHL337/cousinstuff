category: "Surface Rations"
recipeIngredient:
  - "680 g raw Atlantic salmon (4 portions, ~170 g each)"
  - "520 g russet potatoes, diced (about 1.5–2 lb)"
  - "400–480 g broccoli florets"
  - "4 tsp olive oil"
  - "2 tbsp lemon juice"
  - "1 tsp garlic powder"
  - "1 tsp onion powder"
  - "1 tsp smoked paprika"
  - "1 tsp dried thyme"
  - "3/4 tsp kosher salt (adjust to taste)"
  - "1/2 tsp black pepper (adjust to taste)"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Activate the Glaze: In a small bowl, whisk olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, thyme, salt, and pepper. Set aside."
  - "Roast the Potatoes: Toss diced russet potatoes with ~1/3 of the glaze (just enough to lightly coat). Air fry at 400°F (204°C) for 14–16 minutes, shaking halfway, until crisp-tender. Remove and hold warm."
  - "Crisp the Broccoli: Toss broccoli with a small splash of the glaze (or just salt + a spritz of oil). Air fry at 375°F (190°C) for 6–8 minutes until tender with browned edges. Remove and hold warm."
  - "Hunt the Mirelurk (Salmon): Pat salmon dry. Brush with remaining glaze. Air fry at 390°F (199°C) for 8–10 minutes (thickness-dependent) until flaky and just cooked through."
  - "Assemble: Plate salmon with potatoes and broccoli. Optional: finish with fresh lemon wedges."

## Overview
After the Great Collapse, “Mirelurk meat” became a prized surface protein: dense, sustaining, and worth the risk. This Vault-safe interpretation keeps the vibe, drops the danger, and delivers a family-friendly plate that still works inside a cut.

**Theme:** Surface Protein Ration  
**Profile:** High-protein, moderate-carb, kid-safe  
**Method:** Air fryer (fast + repeatable)  
**Vibe:** Crispy edges, herby-citrus finish, comfort dinner without drama

## Cut-Friendly Target (Per Adult Serving)
Approximate values (will vary by salmon type and potato size):

- **Calories:** ~470  
- **Protein:** ~39 g  
- **Carbs:** ~30 g  
- **Fat:** ~19 g  

## Vault Notes
### Family Dial
- **Kid-safe default:** as written (no heat).
- **Adult “afterburn” option:** add chili flakes or a hot sauce drizzle *after plating* (keeps the base kid-friendly).

### Portion Control (If You Need to Tighten Macros)
- **Lower carbs:** drop potatoes to **100 g raw per serving** (400 g total).
- **Lower fat:** use **5 oz (142 g) salmon per serving** instead of 6 oz.
- **More volume:** increase broccoli freely (very low calorie impact).

### Timing Tips (Single Air Fryer)
1) Potatoes first (hold warm)  
2) Broccoli second (hold warm)  
3) Salmon last (serve immediately)

## Serve With
- Lemon wedges
- A simple side salad (mixed greens + vinegar)
- Pickles (Vault brine counts as morale)
